City Council districts are a key factor for New York City to obtain statistics such as homelessness populations, number of units in shelters, and the demographics of those in shelters. Family homelessness impacts every community when it comes to risk factors, community resources, child hunger, affordable housing, and local needs.

<br>
<br>
  
Looking at the map below, City Council District 15 (Belmont/Fordham, Bronx) holds the most family shelters in the city with 774 units. However, City Council District 16 (Concourse/Highbridge, Bronx), with 30 family shelters, holds 1,106 units, which represents 10% of all shelter units in the city.

Within these findings, ICPH reported that multiple City Council districts are at high risk of losing affordable units due to the expiration of affordability clauses. The top five City Council districts facing this risk are Districts 1 (Chinatown/Financial District, Manhattan), 3 (Chelsea/Midtown South, Manhattan), 6 (Lincoln Square/Upper West Side, Manhattan), 12 (Eastchester/Williamsbridge, Bronx), and 33 (Downtown Brooklyn/Williamsburg).

Jacquelyn Simone, Policy Director for the Coalition for the Homeless, said in a statement that Mayor Eric Adams' treatment for homeless and mentally ill people are ineffective.

<br>
<br>

"Homeless people are more likely to be the victims of crimes than the perpetrators, but Mayor Adams has continually scapegoated homeless people and others with mental illness as violent. Further, his focus on involuntary transport and treatment ignores that many people cannot access psychiatric care even on a voluntary basis." Simone said. "Even more, Mayor Adams’ call for enrolling more people in shelters in Medicaid is not a real solution. Of the 93,925 adults eligible in December 2021 to receive enhanced mental health services in NYC under the State’s Medicaid managed care program for those with serious mental illnesses, only 2,179 — 2.3 percent — actually received such care in the prior 12 months."

Although District 15 (Belmont/Fordham, Bronx) has 35 family shelters, the district could still lose over 3,700 affordable housing units within five years due to affordability clause expiration. In addition, Queens does not have many shelters. Districts 21 (Corona/East Elmhurst) and 24 (Jamaica Center/Kew Garden Hills), for example, have combined about 7,500 affordable housing housing units. Almost 3,000 units are at risk of being lost in the next five years; similar to District 15.
    
<br>
<br>

Overall, the City Council districts with the most family shelter units are Districts 8 (East Harlem/Mott Haven), 15 (Belmont), 16 (Concourse), 17 (Hunts Point), and 37 (Cypress Hills). Staten Island is the borough with the least amount of family shelters; with only one family shelter with 46 units in City Council District 49 (Port Richmond/Stapleton).
